As technology becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, these laws serve as a moral compass, ensuring that data and AI applications respect fundamental human values. The right to privacy becomes particularly crucial in an age of data-driven innovations, preventing unauthorised intrusion into personal lives. Moreover, protection against discrimination upholds the principle of fairness, guarding against biassed algorithms that could perpetuate inequalities. By adhering to human rights laws, data and AI technologies can not only be ethically developed but also contribute positively to a just and equitable society.</p><p>The modern concept of human rights emerged in the aftermath of World War II, catalysed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The UDHR set a universal standard for the inherent rights and freedoms to which all individuals are entitled. Over time, these principles have been enshrined in various international treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).</p><p>Nations around the world have recognised the significance of human rights, incorporating them into their legal systems. These rights address crucial aspects of human existence, including the right to privacy, non-discrimination, and freedom of expression. For instance, Europe's Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) has become a cornerstone in the protection of individual rights across europe.</p><p>In the context of AI and data ethics, human rights provide a solid ethical foundation. They remind us that technological advancements must not compromise individual freedoms, fairness, or dignity.

These laws, closely tied to the principles of human rights, ensure that personal data is collected, processed, and shared responsibly. Prominent examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States.</p><p>In the context of data and AI, data protection laws hold significant importance. While they encompass various lawful bases for processing personal data beyond explicit consent, they also include provisions that specifically impact AI applications. For instance, the GDPR grants individuals the right to not be subject to automated decision-making and profiling, offering safeguards against the potential biases and discrimination that can arise from AI algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>By emphasising individuals' rights over personal data and how, and where it can be processed, data protection laws provide a strong foundation for AI development. These regulations encourage transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI systems, fostering a landscape where innovation coexists harmoniously with respect for individuals' privacy and rights.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ePrivacy and cookie laws&nbsp;</strong></p><p>ePrivacy and “cookie laws” play a vital role in the modern digital landscape by addressing the intricacies of communication and data transmission. Notable examples include the EU ePrivacy Directive and subsequent implementations including the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) in the UK.</p><p>Such laws are all-encompassing, applying to a wide array of electronic communications, spanning emails, messages, and more. These regulations also extend their reach to tracking technologies, including the ubiquitous use of cookies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p><p>Cookies (think of them as small bits of information, like breadcrumbs) enable websites to personalise the user experience. For example, ecommerce websites use cookies to know what merchandise users have placed in their shopping carts, even before any identification or authentication. They are essentially a short term memory for a web browser that helps remember a user's choices. At the ODI we think of this as behavioural data. It may not be personal, but evidence shows that as you collect more of it, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://howthey.watch/you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identification becomes easier</a> and how it can be used unethically becomes clearer.&nbsp;</p><p>For data and AI, the impact of these laws is significant. They ensure that individuals retain control over their online experiences, granting them the right to decide which tracking technologies they consent to. Even in cases where data collected might not be tied to an individual's identity, these regulations emphasise the importance of transparency and choice. This becomes particularly crucial as AI systems analyse a diverse range of data, some of which might not appear personal at first glance. The ethical framework thus established aligns with the overarching principles of fairness, accountability, and respect for user autonomy, reinforcing the integral connection between data ethics and regulatory compliance.</p>","_imageAlignment":"full","_graphic":{"src":"","alt":"","attribution":"Copyright © 2019"},"_classes":""}],"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true}},{"_id":"aide-m3-o2-exploring-de-regulations-c-6","_parentId":"aide-m3-o2-exploring-de-regulations-b-6","_type":"component","_component":"accordion","_classes":"","_layout":"full","title":"Intellectual Property Rights ","displayTitle":"","body":"<p>Video 3 - Key regulations in the digital, data, and AI spaces Part 3: General Regulations - Intellectual Property</p><h2>Video script</h2>","instruction":"Select the headings to find out more.","_shouldCollapseItems":true,"_shouldExpandFirstItem":false,"_setCompletionOn":"allItems","_items":[{"title":"Video script","body":"<p>Intellectual property rights play a pivotal role in the digital landscape, encompassing legal protections for creative works, innovations, and proprietary data.

However, training an AI on copyrighted material introduces several unique concerns.</p>\r\n<p>One of the main concerns relates to that of derivative works. While it is a human&rsquo;s conscious choice to create a derivative work based upon someone else&rsquo;s property, the human developing an AI may not be aware that the AI has created a derivative work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To demonstrate this, consider the scenarios. How likely do you think legal action would be as a result of using AI to create each of the following:</p>\r\n<p>A pop song that borrows elements from the songs of Marvin Gaye</p>\r\n<p>A Valentine&rsquo;s Day poem for your partner</p>\r\n<p>A potential plotline for an 8th book in the Harry Potter series</p>\r\n<p>Starting with our poem, we can see here that there is no intent to create a derivative work. So any infringement would arguably be coincidental. In 2023 Ed Sheeran was cleared of infringing copyright in Marvin Gaye lawsuit after he successfully argued that his songs used common chord progressions that are the &ldquo;letters of the alphabet of music&rdquo; and widely used. Clearly however, the intention to directly borrow elements of the songs of Marvin Gaye would be different and constitute copyright infringement. The same is true for writing an 8th book in the Harry Potter series. Although much exists in terms of fanfiction around the Harry Potter universe, much is there so people can create and develop their own creativity. Clearly if the intention were to try to cash in on the success of J K Rowling then things would change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, copyright is about intent. The intent to deliberately cash in on the work of others will most likely end up with a court case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, what about AI? Does it make copying too easy and where is the intention? If AI is not trained on copyrighted material, will it ever be useful to everyone? We need to balance the societal benefit with the potential negative impacts, another ethical consideration.</p>","_id":"6408b85eb38aaf6b93dd7ddf","_parentId":"aide-m3-o5-third-party-b-30","_type":"component","_layout":"full","_onScreen":{"_isEnabled":false,"_classes":"","_percentInviewVertical":50},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false},"instruction":""},{"_component":"text","_classes":"","_isOptional":false,"_isAvailable":true,"_isHidden":false,"_isVisible":true,"_isResetOnRevisit":"false","_ariaLevel":0,"_disableAccessibilityState":false,"title":"Establishing the suitability of data prior to access and reuse","displayTitle":"","body":"<p><strong>Examining the environment surrounding the data:</strong></p><ul><li>Clarifying the purpose for the data collection; is this clearly articulated and will the purpose have any significant impact on the potential reuse?</li><li>Who collects and manages the data?

One the main reasons data is not shared is the lack of clear data sharing agreements or licences that can be used to safely share&nbsp;data while protecting the interests of the data owner.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This module introduces the key role of data sharing agreements and data licences as ways to safely share data and maximise its

A data sharing agreement ensures that both parties have a clear understanding of how the shared data will be used, including access rights, data security measures, and limitations on data sharing. This helps establish trust and accountability between the collaborators.</p> <h2>Fraud detection</h2> <p>Financial organisations are required to collaborate in order to maintain a stable market. One aspect of this is sharing data that assists the detection of fraudulent transactions, often using automated models. A data sharing agreement outlines the terms of data contribution, data access, and the responsibilities of each organisation in maintaining data privacy. It also defines the rights to use the resulting model and how any insights or improvements will be shared.</p> <h2>Species protection</h2> <p>AI is increasingly used to help build climate models that help predict the impact on our habitat. One key aspect of this is to model the threat to endangered species, data about which might include information about the location, behaviour, and habitat of these species. Sharing this data without proper controls could lead to poaching, habitat destruction, or disturbance to their ecosystems, endangering their survival further. By applying data sharing agreements in this context, AI can be used effectively to model species movement while respecting the ethical considerations and responsibilities associated with endangered species protection.</p>","_id":"6408b2dfb38aaf6b93dd7d7f","_parentId":"aide-m3-o3-sharing-b-10","_type":"component","_layout":"full","_onScreen":{"_isEnabled":false,"_classes":"","_percentInviewVertical":50},"_tutor":{"_isInherited":true,"_type":"notify","_classes":"","_hasNotifyBottomButton":false,"_button":{"text":"{{_globals._extensions._tutor.hideFeedback}}","ariaLabel":"{{_globals._extensions._tutor.hideFeedback}}"}},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false},"instruction":""},{"_component":"dragndrop","_classes":"","_isOptional":false,"_isAvailable":true,"_isHidden":false,"_isVisible":true,"_isResetOnRevisit":"false","_ariaLevel":0,"_disableAccessibilityState":false,"title":"Building a data licence","displayTitle":"","body":"<p>A data licence grants up-front permission to use and reuse data, so long as the user complies with a specified set of terms.

This phase involves identifying and understanding the ethical dilemma at hand. Clarity in defining the situation is crucial for several reasons:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Contextual Understanding</strong>: Clearly defining the situation provides context and background information. It helps stakeholders understand the specific circumstances, parties involved, and the nature of the ethical challenge.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Stakeholder Identification</strong>: By clarifying the situation, you can identify all parties who may be affected by the decision. This includes individuals, groups, organisations, or communities that have a stake in the outcome.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Scope Delimitation</strong>: A well-defined situation helps establish the scope of the ethical evaluation. It outlines the boundaries of the ethical dilemma and prevents ambiguity that can lead to irrelevant considerations.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Issue Recognition</strong>: Clear definition of the situation enables the identification of the core ethical issue. This helps avoid confusion and ensures that the ethical evaluation remains focused on the essential aspects.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Informed Analysis</strong>: An accurately described situation provides the necessary information for ethical analysis. Ethical theories and principles can be applied more effectively when the situation is well-understood.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Ethical Implications</strong>: A precise understanding of the situation allows for a more comprehensive exploration of potential ethical implications. It helps uncover the different angles, consequences, and considerations associated with the dilemma.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Objective Decision-Making</strong>: Clarity in the situation promotes objective decision-making. A well-defined situation reduces the risk of bias or misinterpretation influencing the ethical evaluation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Communication and Transparency</strong>: A clear description of the situation enables effective communication with stakeholders. Transparent communication builds trust and helps stakeholders understand the rationale behind the decisions made.</li>\n</ol><p>In essence, being clear on the situation is akin to laying the groundwork for a solid ethical evaluation.

Care should be taken to not fall into bad habit that will erode trust including:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> When organisations or individuals withhold information, intentions, or actions, it can lead to suspicions and undermine trust. The absence of clear communication and openness can breed uncertainty among stakeholders. It is not always deliberate, but taking the time early to prioritise transparency will pay back dividends later.</li>\n<li><strong>Blame Culture:</strong> In environments where blame is disproportionately assigned rather than problems being collectively addressed, trust erodes. This culture discourages individuals from taking ownership and fosters a sense of insecurity and ultimately results in a lack of accountability, one of the key guiding principles.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconsistent Messaging:</strong> When messages or actions contradict each other, it can create confusion and scepticism. Inconsistent communication undermines trust in the authenticity of intentions.</li>\n<li><strong>Unaccountable Behaviour:</strong> When individuals or entities avoid taking responsibility for their actions and consequences, it diminishes trust. Unaccountable behaviour erodes confidence in the reliability of promises.</li>\n<li><strong>Hidden Agendas:</strong> Concealed motives or undisclosed interests can lead to suspicions of ulterior motives. When stakeholders perceive hidden agendas, it weakens trust in the integrity of decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Unequal Treatment:</strong> When favouritism or unequal treatment becomes evident, trust in fairness is compromised. This can manifest as preferential treatment based on personal connections rather than merit.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Inclusivity:</strong> Exclusion or lack of involvement of stakeholders in decision-making processes can generate feelings of mistrust. When individuals are excluded, it implies that their perspectives are not valued.</li>\n<li><strong>Inaction on Feedback:</strong> Ignoring or dismissing feedback from stakeholders suggests a disregard for their opinions and needs. This inaction can breed mistrust as stakeholders feel unheard.</li>\n<li><strong>Secrecy Surrounding Decisions:</strong> When decisions are made behind closed doors without transparency or input, it can foster scepticism and mistrust about the motives and rationale behind those decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent Ethical Violations:</strong> Frequent ethical violations or a pattern of unethical behaviour can erode trust over time.

This AI-driven endeavour aimed to streamline the screening process and identify the most promising candidates, offering a potential solution to the company's recruitment challenges.</p><p><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p>Amazon's initiative to develop an AI-powered recruitment tool reflects their proactive approach to grappling with the complexities of handling a large number of applications. By utilising AI algorithms to automate preliminary screening, the company intended to optimise the hiring process, improve efficiency, and allocate human resources more effectively. It was noted at this stage that the tool was biased toward men and ultimately this led to the decision following being an easy one to make. However, a notable weakness during the analysis was a failure to recognise legal and ethical challenges relating to the use of personal data in resumes submitted over a 10-year period to train the tool.</p><p><strong>Decision</strong></p><p>Upon critical examination of the AI system's outcomes, Amazon chose not to employ the technology for final hiring decisions due to identified gender bias concerns. However, the company opted to leverage some components of the tool for ancillary functions, revealing their adaptability and commitment to refining their approach based on the ethical implications that emerged during analysis. Even though this is a somewhat positive outcome, Amazon's decision to keep the AI project and the associated data's use confidential to this point was their undoing.</p><p><strong>Action and Monitoring</strong></p><p>Amazon's action to not use the tool does offer some hope of them taking ethical responsibility. Despite choosing not to proceed with the tool for hiring decisions, they found value in repurposing it to filter out duplicates and ensure basic application criteria alignment. However, the secretive nature of the project and the use of personal data without explicit consent eroded trust, casting a shadow over the entire initiative. Although Amazon claimed never to have used the tool, the lack of transparency surrounding both the project and the data used for training fueled scepticism and undermined the company's reputation. This clearly demonstrates that the ethical decision-making process marks the beginning of a journey filled with responsibilities and commitments and should start before any analysis or application.&nbsp;</p><p>In this context, Amazon's venture into AI-driven recruitment highlights the intricate interplay between technology, ethics, and transparency. While the initiative demonstrated Amazon's commitment to ethical decision-making by discontinuing biassed AI usage, the secrecy surrounding the development and data usage led to a loss of trust. This scenario underscores the importance of open communication, transparency, and safeguarding individual data privacy when implementing AI solutions to address complex challenges, even if you don’t end up using them.</p>","instruction":"","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false}},{"_id":"m2-07-ethical-dm-c-18","_parentId":"m2-07-ethical-dm-b-18","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"full","title":"How SAD are you?","displayTitle":"How SAD are you?","body":"<p>How much can you remember about the model, test your knowledge with our short quiz.</p>","instruction":"","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false}},{"_id":"m2-07-ethical-dm-c-19","_parentId":"m2-07-ethical-dm-b-19","_type":"component","_component":"mcq","_classes":"","_layout":"right","title":"Defining situations","displayTitle":"Defining situations","body":"","instruction":"Choose one option then select Submit.","ariaQuestion":"Question text specifically for screen readers.","_attempts":1,"_shouldDisplayAttempts":false,"_isRandom":false,"_hasItemScoring":false,"_questionWeight":1,"_selectable":1,"_canShowModelAnswer":true,"_canShowFeedback":true,"_canShowMarking":true,"_recordInteraction":true,"_items":[{"text":"Clear context","_shouldBeSelected":true,"_isPartlyCorrect":false},{"text":"Clear objective","_shouldBeSelected":true,"_isPartlyCorrect":false},{"text":"Clear on the data/technology being considered","_shouldBeSelected":true,"_isPartlyCorrect":false},{"text":"Short","_shouldBeSelected":false,"_isPartlyCorrect":false},{"text":"Focus on new technologies","_shouldBeSelected":false,"_isPartlyCorrect":false}],"_feedback":{"correct":"<p><strong>That's right!</p></strong></p><p>In ethical evaluation, well-scoped scenarios are crucial as they define the boundaries, stakeholders, data types, intended outcomes, and contexts of use.

AI applications can impact individual rights, societal well-being, fairness, privacy, and other values, each of which may align better with a particular ethical perspective. As a result, ethical pluralism encourages a flexible and context-sensitive approach to ethical analysis and decision-making in AI development, deployment, and use.</p><p>How Ethical Pluralism Applies in AI:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Balancing Conflicting Values</strong>: Ethical pluralism allows AI developers and stakeholders to navigate situations where different values or principles may come into conflict. For instance, balancing the interests and rights of individuals with the benefits of data-driven AI services requires considering both rights-based ethics and utilitarianism.</li>\n<li><strong>Holistic Analysis</strong>: Ethical pluralism encourages a more comprehensive analysis by considering multiple ethical perspectives. This can lead to a more well-rounded understanding of the potential ethical implications of AI technologies.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural and Contextual Variability</strong>: Different cultures and contexts may prioritise various ethical values differently. Ethical pluralism accommodates these variations and encourages adapting ethical considerations to the specific environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Nature of AI</strong>: AI technologies evolve rapidly, leading to new ethical challenges. Ethical pluralism allows for agility in addressing emerging ethical concerns without being constrained by a single framework.</li>\n<li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: Ethical pluralism can facilitate constructive dialogues among stakeholders with diverse perspectives. It recognizes that individuals may resonate with different ethical frameworks based on their backgrounds and roles.</li>\n</ol><p>By adopting an ethical pluralism approach in AI, organisations can create a more inclusive and adaptable ethical foundation.

We will dissect this scenario, considering how different ethical frameworks were applied, and how the consequences of those decisions played out. We will explore what could have been done differently and how a more balanced consideration of various ethical perspectives might have led to a more equitable outcome.</p><p>Scenario: In 2020, the United Kingdom faced a challenging situation in grading students' exams due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess students' grades, an algorithmic approach was initially adopted, which aimed to standardise results across schools. However, this algorithm faced widespread backlash for disproportionately affecting students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The government subsequently shifted to using teacher-assessed grades, aiming to rectify these disparities. While this decision addressed some concerns, it led to challenges such as high numbers of students being eligible for university places and concerns about future exam grade inflation. As we reflect on this situation, let's consider the ethical frameworks that were most strongly applied and which ones could have been applied more effectively.</p><p>Ethical Frameworks Considered:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Utilitarianism</strong>:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially: The algorithmic approach might have aimed to maximise fairness and uniformity across schools, but its implementation led to significant distress and dissatisfaction among students and parents.</li>\n<li>Teacher-assessed grades: The switch to teacher assessments aimed to minimise harm and distress for students, but the subsequent challenges raised questions about the overall well-being of the broader education system.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Deontology</strong>:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially: The algorithmic approach adhered to predefined rules and criteria for grading, but the strong public reaction indicated that these rules might not have sufficiently considered the individual circumstances of students.</li>\n<li>Teacher-assessed grades: This approach could be seen as a response to the ethical duty of treating each student as an individual, focusing on their unique abilities and efforts rather than strictly following an algorithm.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Justice and Fairness</strong>:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially: The algorithmic approach aimed to ensure standardised grading, but its failure to address disparities in students' backgrounds raised concerns about fairness and social justice.</li>\n<li>Teacher-assessed grades: This approach aimed to address the fairness concerns by allowing educators to account for students' personal situations, but the challenges of grade inflation and university admissions highlighted the complexity of achieving fairness for all.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Ethics of Care</strong>:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Teacher-assessed grades: The shift to teacher assessments might reflect the consideration of students' well-being, as teachers could provide a more nuanced understanding of their capabilities and challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Rights-based Ethics</strong>:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially: The algorithmic approach could be interpreted as an attempt to uphold students' right to a fair and objective assessment. However, its shortcomings demonstrated the importance of ensuring students' rights to accurate evaluation.</li>\n<li>Teacher-assessed grades: This approach aimed to respect students' right to an individualised assessment, but the potential consequences for future students and university admissions raised questions about the broader impact on their rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Virtue Ethics</strong>:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Both approaches: The virtues of empathy, responsibility, and fairness could have played roles in guiding decisions. Considering the well-being of students, their futures, and the education system as a whole aligns with virtuous decision-making.</li>\n</ul>\n</ol><p>Considering the scenario, it's clear that multiple ethical frameworks were at play. While the government's response indicated consideration of utilitarianism, deontology, and justice, other frameworks like ethics of care and virtue ethics could have been applied more robustly to address the complexities of individual student needs, long-term consequences, and fostering a supportive educational environment. By recognizing the strengths and limitations of each framework, we can better navigate similar challenging situations in the future.</p>","instruction":"","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false}},{"_id":"aide-m2-o3-ethical-frameworks-1c-19","_parentId":"aide-m2-o3-ethical-frameworks-1b-19","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"left","title":"Using ethical questions to improve diversity in ethics committees","displayTitle":"Using ethical questions to improve diversity in ethics committees","body":"<p>Organisations often establish ethical committees to guide decisions and navigate complex issues.
