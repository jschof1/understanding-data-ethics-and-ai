That purpose has value - and through these products we are seeking to realise that value. However, just as there are deliberate benefits we seek, there lurk risks of unintended consequences.</p><p>Data ethics plays a pivotal role in navigating this delicate balance. By adhering to ethical principles, we can mitigate these unforeseen risks and ensure that data is used in a manner consistent with societal norms and values. This not only safeguards individuals and communities from potential harm but also reinforces trust. When users and stakeholders perceive that data is being managed with integrity and respect, they are more likely to engage with and endorse the products and services on offer. In essence, data ethics becomes a cornerstone for fostering trust. By transparently addressing concerns and demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices, organisations can build stronger, trust-based relationships with their customers, enhancing both their reputation and the overall effectiveness of their data centric endeavours.</p>",

In the video, a white man and a dark-skinned black man both try to get soap from a soap dispenser. The soap dispenses for the white man, but not the darker skinned man.\n\nThis video of the incident went viral, raising concerns about potential racial bias in technology. The lack of diversity in the training data is pointed out as a possible cause of the biassed outcome, emphasising the importance of using inclusive data sets for AI technology development.\n\nThe incident has sparked discussions on racial discrimination in AI algorithms and has amplified calls for greater awareness and responsibility in developing AI systems to avoid unintentional discrimination. Overall, it serves as a reminder of the need for ethical and diverse testing approaches to ensure fairness in AI technologies.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817030963?h=b9ef979956&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" title=\"why is data ethics important\"></iframe>\n\nWhile soap dispensers are a more light-hearted example, this same problem has been documented in wearable fitness trackers and heart-rate monitors, and also in medical applications.",

For instance, if Melanoma is diagnosed early, an individual has a 100% chance of surviving over 1 year. However, this drops to 53% if diagnosed at a later stage. Notably, people with non-white skin, though less prone to skin cancer, exhibit lower 5-year survival rates (70%) compared to white individuals (92%) [1].\n\nThis highlights issues within our healthcare systems, but also an issue for those organisations who are developing technologies that utilise machine learning to support diagnosis. The video below explores this example in more depth and introduces the First Derm [2] dataset as an example.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817240774?h=1cdc6f2d90&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" title=\"why is data ethics important\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Broadly, there are two proposed approaches to mitigating this bias:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Increasing the variety of the data to build a more representative dataset</li>\r\n<li>Train a different system on a dataset of 90% non-white images to maintain higher accuracy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Both approaches require different considerations for the creation and use of data, and whilst both have merit as approaches to mitigation there are still further considerations to be taken into account to address future challenges.</p>\r\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\r\n<p>It is not just non-white people who are excluded from medical research.

In their study, Wu and Zhang delved into using machine learning to identify facial traits linked to \"criminality.\" They asserted that their algorithms could accurately differentiate between criminals and non-criminals using basic headshot images.</p>\r\n<p>Wu and Zhang&rsquo;s claim?</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Unlike a human examiner/judge, a computer vision algorithm or classifier has absolutely no subjective baggages [sic], having no emotions, no biases whatsoever due to past experience, race, religion, political doctrine, gender, age, etc., no mental fatigue, no preconditioning of a bad sleep or meal. The automated inference on criminality eliminates the variable meta-accuracy (the competence of the human judge/examiner) all together&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In short, they stated that the computer is entirely objective. Do you agree? Let&rsquo;s explore this idea in more detail:</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817271706?h=ff16aca3bd&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" title=\"Data Ethics - Criminal Faces\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Machines have been proven over and over to emphasise bias, not decrease it. The one thing machines are good at is consistency. So they will be concisely biassed and don&rsquo;t flit about like humans are prone to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Biases in images and image recognition systems result from how these systems have been trained. Understanding this history of image recognition training data can go a long way to tell us why newer systems are showing biases. If your dataset contains images of people smiling (the non-criminals) and those who aren&rsquo;t (the criminals), you do exactly what Wu and Zhang did - you build a smile detector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n<p>Wu, X., &amp; Zhang, X.

As technology becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, these laws serve as a moral compass, ensuring that data and AI applications respect fundamental human values. The right to privacy becomes particularly crucial in an age of data-driven innovations, preventing unauthorised intrusion into personal lives. Moreover, protection against discrimination upholds the principle of fairness, guarding against biassed algorithms that could perpetuate inequalities. By adhering to human rights laws, data and AI technologies can not only be ethically developed but also contribute positively to a just and equitable society.</p><p>The modern concept of human rights emerged in the aftermath of World War II, catalysed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The UDHR set a universal standard for the inherent rights and freedoms to which all individuals are entitled. Over time, these principles have been enshrined in various international treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).</p><p>Nations around the world have recognised the significance of human rights, incorporating them into their legal systems. These rights address crucial aspects of human existence, including the right to privacy, non-discrimination, and freedom of expression. For instance, Europe's Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) has become a cornerstone in the protection of individual rights across europe.</p><p>In the context of AI and data ethics, human rights provide a solid ethical foundation. They remind us that technological advancements must not compromise individual freedoms, fairness, or dignity. By embracing human rights principles, the development and deployment of data and AI technologies can contribute to a world where innovation harmoniously coexists with respect for human values.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Data protection laws play a pivotal role in safeguarding individuals' rights and upholding their privacy in an increasingly data-driven world. These laws, closely tied to the principles of human rights, ensure that personal data is collected, processed, and shared responsibly. Prominent examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States.</p><p>In the context of data and AI, data protection laws hold significant importance. While they encompass various lawful bases for processing personal data beyond explicit consent, they also include provisions that specifically impact AI applications. For instance, the GDPR grants individuals the right to not be subject to automated decision-making and profiling, offering safeguards against the potential biases and discrimination that can arise from AI algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>By emphasising individuals' rights over personal data and how, and where it can be processed, data protection laws provide a strong foundation for AI development. These regulations encourage transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI systems, fostering a landscape where innovation coexists harmoniously with respect for individuals' privacy and rights.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ePrivacy and cookie laws&nbsp;</strong></p><p>ePrivacy and “cookie laws” play a vital role in the modern digital landscape by addressing the intricacies of communication and data transmission. Notable examples include the EU ePrivacy Directive and subsequent implementations including the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) in the UK.</p><p>Such laws are all-encompassing, applying to a wide array of electronic communications, spanning emails, messages, and more. These regulations also extend their reach to tracking technologies, including the ubiquitous use of cookies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p><p>Cookies (think of them as small bits of information, like breadcrumbs) enable websites to personalise the user experience. For example, ecommerce websites use cookies to know what merchandise users have placed in their shopping carts, even before any identification or authentication. They are essentially a short term memory for a web browser that helps remember a user's choices. At the ODI we think of this as behavioural data. It may not be personal, but evidence shows that as you collect more of it, <a href=\"https://howthey.watch/you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identification becomes easier</a> and how it can be used unethically becomes clearer.&nbsp;</p><p>For data and AI, the impact of these laws is significant. They ensure that individuals retain control over their online experiences, granting them the right to decide which tracking technologies they consent to. Even in cases where data collected might not be tied to an individual's identity, these regulations emphasise the importance of transparency and choice. This becomes particularly crucial as AI systems analyse a diverse range of data, some of which might not appear personal at first glance. The ethical framework thus established aligns with the overarching principles of fairness, accountability, and respect for user autonomy, reinforcing the integral connection between data ethics and regulatory compliance.</p>",

Emerging technologies, such as AI and blockchain, frequently outpace the establishment of comprehensive regulations. This can create a gap wherein the ethical considerations are less codified. Organisations navigating this terrain often grapple with ethical challenges that arise when regulatory guidance is either lacking or inadequate. For example, while data protection regulations are clear, how to address algorithmic bias is not codified in law.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"sub-header\"> <h3 class=\"bold-color-text\">As organisations navigate this landscape, they should:</h3> </div> <ul class=\"styled-links\"> <li class=\"callout-border-bold-list\"><strong>Evaluate Alignment:</strong> Assess how existing ethical principles align with regulatory requirements.

Regulations, such as GDPR, are increasingly punitive not only due to the occurrence of a data breach but also due to evident inadequacies in processes, lack of transparency, and weak governance. Even organisations with exemplary security measures can face breaches stemming from rapidly evolving cyber threats. Embracing transparency in data handling practices and technological advancements not only cultivates a culture of trustworthiness but also equips organisations for upcoming regulations that demand heightened reporting, implementation of risk management processes, and enhanced transparency.</p>",
