However, just as there are deliberate benefits we seek, there lurk risks of unintended consequences.</p><p>Data ethics plays a pivotal role in navigating this delicate balance. By adhering to ethical principles, we can mitigate these unforeseen risks and ensure that data is used in a manner consistent with societal norms and values. This not only safeguards individuals and communities from potential harm but also reinforces trust. When users and stakeholders perceive that data is being managed with integrity and respect, they are more likely to engage with and endorse the products and services on offer. In essence, data ethics becomes a cornerstone for fostering trust. By transparently addressing concerns and demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices, organisations can build stronger, trust-based relationships with their customers, enhancing both their reputation and the overall effectiveness of their data centric endeavours.</p>","_id":"64f1c12c94389ef9d9f9555f","_parentId":"64f1c12b94389ef9d9f95554","_type":"component","_layout":"full","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false},"instruction":""},{"_component":"accordion","_classes":"","_isOptional":false,"_isAvailable":true,"_isHidden":false,"_isVisible":true,"_isResetOnRevisit":"false","_ariaLevel":0,"_disableAccessibilityState":false,"title":"Data ethics in practice (..or not)","displayTitle":"Data ethics in practice (..or not)","body":"Unfortunately, there is no shortage of stories that demonstrate negative impacts of data practices.  The following examples demonstrate where a lack of focus on data ethics has resulted in a negative impact on individuals and society.\nAs you read and watch the following examples, consider what stage of the data lifecycle we are at, and what that means for the different considerations we need to make.","_id":"64f1c12c94389ef9d9f95560","_parentId":"64f1c12b94389ef9d9f95555","_type":"component","_layout":"full","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false},"instruction":"Select the headings to find out more.","_shouldCollapseItems":true,"_shouldExpandFirstItem":false,"_comment":"setCompletionOn = inview | allItems","_setCompletionOn":"allItems","_items":[{"title":"Twitter image cropper","body":"In September 2020, Twitter's photo cropping algorithm faced criticism for possible racial bias.

In the video, a white man and a dark-skinned black man both try to get soap from a soap dispenser. The soap dispenses for the white man, but not the darker skinned man.\n\nThis video of the incident went viral, raising concerns about potential racial bias in technology. The lack of diversity in the training data is pointed out as a possible cause of the biassed outcome, emphasising the importance of using inclusive data sets for AI technology development.\n\nThe incident has sparked discussions on racial discrimination in AI algorithms and has amplified calls for greater awareness and responsibility in developing AI systems to avoid unintentional discrimination.

As technology becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, these laws serve as a moral compass, ensuring that data and AI applications respect fundamental human values. The right to privacy becomes particularly crucial in an age of data-driven innovations, preventing unauthorised intrusion into personal lives. Moreover, protection against discrimination upholds the principle of fairness, guarding against biassed algorithms that could perpetuate inequalities. By adhering to human rights laws, data and AI technologies can not only be ethically developed but also contribute positively to a just and equitable society.</p><p>The modern concept of human rights emerged in the aftermath of World War II, catalysed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The UDHR set a universal standard for the inherent rights and freedoms to which all individuals are entitled. Over time, these principles have been enshrined in various international treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).</p><p>Nations around the world have recognised the significance of human rights, incorporating them into their legal systems. These rights address crucial aspects of human existence, including the right to privacy, non-discrimination, and freedom of expression. For instance, Europe's Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) has become a cornerstone in the protection of individual rights across europe.</p><p>In the context of AI and data ethics, human rights provide a solid ethical foundation.

These laws, closely tied to the principles of human rights, ensure that personal data is collected, processed, and shared responsibly. Prominent examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States.</p><p>In the context of data and AI, data protection laws hold significant importance. While they encompass various lawful bases for processing personal data beyond explicit consent, they also include provisions that specifically impact AI applications. For instance, the GDPR grants individuals the right to not be subject to automated decision-making and profiling, offering safeguards against the potential biases and discrimination that can arise from AI algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>By emphasising individuals' rights over personal data and how, and where it can be processed, data protection laws provide a strong foundation for AI development. These regulations encourage transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI systems, fostering a landscape where innovation coexists harmoniously with respect for individuals' privacy and rights.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ePrivacy and cookie laws&nbsp;</strong></p><p>ePrivacy and “cookie laws” play a vital role in the modern digital landscape by addressing the intricacies of communication and data transmission. Notable examples include the EU ePrivacy Directive and subsequent implementations including the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) in the UK.</p><p>Such laws are all-encompassing, applying to a wide array of electronic communications, spanning emails, messages, and more. These regulations also extend their reach to tracking technologies, including the ubiquitous use of cookies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p><p>Cookies (think of them as small bits of information, like breadcrumbs) enable websites to personalise the user experience. For example, ecommerce websites use cookies to know what merchandise users have placed in their shopping carts, even before any identification or authentication. They are essentially a short term memory for a web browser that helps remember a user's choices. At the ODI we think of this as behavioural data. It may not be personal, but evidence shows that as you collect more of it, <a href=\"https://howthey.watch/you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identification becomes easier</a> and how it can be used unethically becomes clearer.&nbsp;</p><p>For data and AI, the impact of these laws is significant. They ensure that individuals retain control over their online experiences, granting them the right to decide which tracking technologies they consent to. Even in cases where data collected might not be tied to an individual's identity, these regulations emphasise the importance of transparency and choice. This becomes particularly crucial as AI systems analyse a diverse range of data, some of which might not appear personal at first glance.

However, training an AI on copyrighted material introduces several unique concerns.</p>\r\n<p>One of the main concerns relates to that of derivative works. While it is a human&rsquo;s conscious choice to create a derivative work based upon someone else&rsquo;s property, the human developing an AI may not be aware that the AI has created a derivative work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To demonstrate this, consider the scenarios. How likely do you think legal action would be as a result of using AI to create each of the following:</p>\r\n<p>A pop song that borrows elements from the songs of Marvin Gaye</p>\r\n<p>A Valentine&rsquo;s Day poem for your partner</p>\r\n<p>A potential plotline for an 8th book in the Harry Potter series</p>\r\n<p>Starting with our poem, we can see here that there is no intent to create a derivative work. So any infringement would arguably be coincidental. In 2023 Ed Sheeran was cleared of infringing copyright in Marvin Gaye lawsuit after he successfully argued that his songs used common chord progressions that are the &ldquo;letters of the alphabet of music&rdquo; and widely used. Clearly however, the intention to directly borrow elements of the songs of Marvin Gaye would be different and constitute copyright infringement. The same is true for writing an 8th book in the Harry Potter series. Although much exists in terms of fanfiction around the Harry Potter universe, much is there so people can create and develop their own creativity. Clearly if the intention were to try to cash in on the success of J K Rowling then things would change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, copyright is about intent. The intent to deliberately cash in on the work of others will most likely end up with a court case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, what about AI? Does it make copying too easy and where is the intention? If AI is not trained on copyrighted material, will it ever be useful to everyone? We need to balance the societal benefit with the potential negative impacts, another ethical consideration.</p>","_id":"6408b85eb38aaf6b93dd7ddf","_parentId":"aide-m3-o5-third-party-b-30","_type":"component","_layout":"full","_onScreen":{"_isEnabled":false,"_classes":"","_percentInviewVertical":50},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false},"instruction":""},{"_component":"text","_classes":"","_isOptional":false,"_isAvailable":true,"_isHidden":false,"_isVisible":true,"_isResetOnRevisit":"false","_ariaLevel":0,"_disableAccessibilityState":false,"title":"Establishing the suitability of data prior to access and reuse","displayTitle":"","body":"<p><strong>Examining the environment surrounding the data:</strong></p><ul><li>Clarifying the purpose for the data collection; is this clearly articulated and will the purpose have any significant impact on the potential reuse?</li><li>Who collects and manages the data?
