    <h3> Application to our example dataset</h3>
</div>
<p>Remember the questions:</p>
<ol class=\"callout-border-bold-list\">
    <li>Is it possible to single out an individual?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to link records relating to an individual using data already available to people?</li>
    <li>Can information be inferred concerning an individual within the same dataset?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Letâ€™s apply these to the dataset:</p>
<div> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Example value</th> <th>Q1</th> <th>Q2</th> <th>Q3</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Site Type</td> <td>111,999</td> <td>N</td> <td>N</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Call date</td> <td>2020-03-19</td> <td>N</td> <td>N</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Name</td> <td>Joe Bloggs</td> <td>REMOVED FROM DATA</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Date of Birth</td> <td>2005-06-03</td> <td>REMOVED FROM DATA</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Age Band</td> <td>0&ndash;18,19&ndash;69,70&ndash;120</td> <td>N</td> <td>N</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Town/City</td> <td>Matlock</td> <td>N</td> <td>Potentially in some sparsely populated areas. Classifying as low risk.</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Postcode area</td> <td>IG11</td> <td>N</td> <td>Potentially in some sparsely populated areas. Classifying as low risk.</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Profession</td> <td>Student, Counselor</td> <td>N</td> <td>N</td> <td>N</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div>
<p class=\"orange-caution-callout\" style=\"padding: 1em\">For this, it appears our anonymisation is good while
    preserving the objective. There are some acceptable risks associated with sparsely populated areas and we could
    choose to identify these and remove them from the dataset. In spreads of infections, measuring the spread in
    sparsely populated areas is not likely to be of significant interest.</p>
