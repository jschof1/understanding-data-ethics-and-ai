    "body": "<p>In our modern digital age, data has become an invaluable resource, driving innovation and shaping every facet of society. However, unethical data practices can lead to discrimination, unintended harmful consequences, and exacerbate societal inequalities. This can lead to people losing trust in data and the products and services that use it.</p> <p>But it isn&rsquo;t all bad news. Understanding the dual potential of data &mdash; for both benefit and harm &mdash; is a crucial step to ensuring the delivery of impactful and valuable data centric solutions. Delving into the ethical dimensions amidst rapid technological advancements is imperative to ensure that our strides in AI and tech-driven solutions are both effective and equitable.</p> <p>Data ethics is essential to ensure that data is wielded responsibly, keeping harmful impacts to a minimum.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this module we explore why data ethics is important, and examine real-world examples of what can happen when data ethics is not considered and the challenges this creates. In this module you will:</p> <ul> <li>Develop your understanding of data ethics</li> <li>Explore the impact of unethical data practices</li> <li>Consider the intersections of data ethics and data governance</li> <li>Examine the differences in data ethics considerations across the data lifecycle</li> </ul>",

In the video, a white man and a dark-skinned black man both try to get soap from a soap dispenser.

The lack of diversity in the training data is pointed out as a possible cause of the biassed outcome, emphasising the importance of using inclusive data sets for AI technology development.\n\nThe incident has sparked discussions on racial discrimination in AI algorithms and has amplified calls for greater awareness and responsibility in developing AI systems to avoid unintentional discrimination. Overall, it serves as a reminder of the need for ethical and diverse testing approaches to ensure fairness in AI technologies.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817030963?h=b9ef979956&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" title=\"why is data ethics important\"></iframe>\n\nWhile soap dispensers are a more light-hearted example, this same problem has been documented in wearable fitness trackers and heart-rate monitors, and also in medical applications.",

The risk scores applied to these individuals is highly problematic, and as explained, demonstrates how the use of data can lead to remarkably unreliable results.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Overall, Northpointe&rsquo;s assessment tool (COMPAS) correctly predicts recidivism 61 percent of the time. But there are major issues in the risk scores calculated:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Black people are almost twice as likely as white people to be labelled a higher risk, but not actually re-offend<\/li>\r\n<li>White people are more likely to be labelled as lower risk, but more likely to go on to commit other crimes<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Northpointe argued that the COMPAS tool was accurate under its own measures of fairness. Where ProPublica&rsquo;s study challenged the models, classification and measures, Northpointe claimed that ProPublica failed to take into account &ldquo;the different base rates of recidivism for Blacks and Whites&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>This argument is an example of the complexities in the provenance of data and the common issues of large-scale use of algorithms. Since data is often tainted with historic and structural biases, usage of such data in training perpetuates a &lsquo;runaway feedback loop&rsquo; or the &lsquo;garbage in &mdash; garbage out&rsquo; phenomenon in future predictions by that algorithm. This obstructs progress and keeps societies trapped in their own mirror image of status quo.

        "body": "<p>Human rights laws hold immense significance in the realm of data and AI due to their foundational role in safeguarding individual dignity, privacy, and fairness. As technology becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, these laws serve as a moral compass, ensuring that data and AI applications respect fundamental human values. The right to privacy becomes particularly crucial in an age of data-driven innovations, preventing unauthorised intrusion into personal lives. Moreover, protection against discrimination upholds the principle of fairness, guarding against biassed algorithms that could perpetuate inequalities. By adhering to human rights laws, data and AI technologies can not only be ethically developed but also contribute positively to a just and equitable society.</p><p>The modern concept of human rights emerged in the aftermath of World War II, catalysed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The UDHR set a universal standard for the inherent rights and freedoms to which all individuals are entitled. Over time, these principles have been enshrined in various international treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).</p><p>Nations around the world have recognised the significance of human rights, incorporating them into their legal systems. These rights address crucial aspects of human existence, including the right to privacy, non-discrimination, and freedom of expression. For instance, Europe's Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) has become a cornerstone in the protection of individual rights across europe.</p><p>In the context of AI and data ethics, human rights provide a solid ethical foundation. They remind us that technological advancements must not compromise individual freedoms, fairness, or dignity. By embracing human rights principles, the development and deployment of data and AI technologies can contribute to a world where innovation harmoniously coexists with respect for human values.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Data protection laws play a pivotal role in safeguarding individuals' rights and upholding their privacy in an increasingly data-driven world. These laws, closely tied to the principles of human rights, ensure that personal data is collected, processed, and shared responsibly. Prominent examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States.</p><p>In the context of data and AI, data protection laws hold significant importance. While they encompass various lawful bases for processing personal data beyond explicit consent, they also include provisions that specifically impact AI applications. For instance, the GDPR grants individuals the right to not be subject to automated decision-making and profiling, offering safeguards against the potential biases and discrimination that can arise from AI algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>By emphasising individuals' rights over personal data and how, and where it can be processed, data protection laws provide a strong foundation for AI development. These regulations encourage transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI systems, fostering a landscape where innovation coexists harmoniously with respect for individuals' privacy and rights.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ePrivacy and cookie laws&nbsp;</strong></p><p>ePrivacy and “cookie laws” play a vital role in the modern digital landscape by addressing the intricacies of communication and data transmission. Notable examples include the EU ePrivacy Directive and subsequent implementations including the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) in the UK.</p><p>Such laws are all-encompassing, applying to a wide array of electronic communications, spanning emails, messages, and more. These regulations also extend their reach to tracking technologies, including the ubiquitous use of cookies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p><p>Cookies (think of them as small bits of information, like breadcrumbs) enable websites to personalise the user experience. For example, ecommerce websites use cookies to know what merchandise users have placed in their shopping carts, even before any identification or authentication. They are essentially a short term memory for a web browser that helps remember a user's choices. At the ODI we think of this as behavioural data. It may not be personal, but evidence shows that as you collect more of it, <a href=\"https://howthey.watch/you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identification becomes easier</a> and how it can be used unethically becomes clearer.&nbsp;</p><p>For data and AI, the impact of these laws is significant. They ensure that individuals retain control over their online experiences, granting them the right to decide which tracking technologies they consent to. Even in cases where data collected might not be tied to an individual's identity, these regulations emphasise the importance of transparency and choice. This becomes particularly crucial as AI systems analyse a diverse range of data, some of which might not appear personal at first glance. The ethical framework thus established aligns with the overarching principles of fairness, accountability, and respect for user autonomy, reinforcing the integral connection between data ethics and regulatory compliance.</p>",

Emerging technologies, such as AI and blockchain, frequently outpace the establishment of comprehensive regulations. This can create a gap wherein the ethical considerations are less codified. Organisations navigating this terrain often grapple with ethical challenges that arise when regulatory guidance is either lacking or inadequate. For example, while data protection regulations are clear, how to address algorithmic bias is not codified in law.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"sub-header\"> <h3 class=\"bold-color-text\">As organisations navigate this landscape, they should:</h3> </div> <ul class=\"styled-links\"> <li class=\"callout-border-bold-list\"><strong>Evaluate Alignment:</strong> Assess how existing ethical principles align with regulatory requirements. Recognise areas where regulations provide clarity and where ethical considerations offer additional insights.</li> <li class=\"callout-border-bold-list\"><strong>Hold ethics in the same regard as compliance:</strong> Incorporate ethical considerations into decision-making processes alongside compliance assessments. This ensures that choices reflect both legal mandates and moral imperatives.</li> <li class=\"callout-border-bold-list\"><strong>Adaptation and Evolution:</strong> Recognise that regulatory landscapes evolve, and new ethical challenges may arise.

Regulations, such as GDPR, are increasingly punitive not only due to the occurrence of a data breach but also due to evident inadequacies in processes, lack of transparency, and weak governance. Even organisations with exemplary security measures can face breaches stemming from rapidly evolving cyber threats. Embracing transparency in data handling practices and technological advancements not only cultivates a culture of trustworthiness but also equips organisations for upcoming regulations that demand heightened reporting, implementation of risk management processes, and enhanced transparency.</p>",

    "body": "<p>On the subject of risk-based approaches, there is much debate around the acceptability of training an AI on copyrighted material.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In the majority of cases, the act of a human reading copyrighted material published openly on the web does not infringe copyright. However, training an AI on copyrighted material introduces several unique concerns.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the main concerns relates to that of derivative works. While it is a human&rsquo;s conscious choice to create a derivative work based upon someone else&rsquo;s property, the human developing an AI may not be aware that the AI has created a derivative work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To demonstrate this, consider the scenarios. How likely do you think legal action would be as a result of using AI to create each of the following:<\/p>\r\n<p>A pop song that borrows elements from the songs of Marvin Gaye<\/p>\r\n<p>A Valentine&rsquo;s Day poem for your partner<\/p>\r\n<p>A potential plotline for an 8th book in the Harry Potter series<\/p>\r\n<p>Starting with our poem, we can see here that there is no intent to create a derivative work. So any infringement would arguably be coincidental. In 2023 Ed Sheeran was cleared of infringing copyright in Marvin Gaye lawsuit after he successfully argued that his songs used common chord progressions that are the &ldquo;letters of the alphabet of music&rdquo; and widely used. Clearly however, the intention to directly borrow elements of the songs of Marvin Gaye would be different and constitute copyright infringement. The same is true for writing an 8th book in the Harry Potter series. Although much exists in terms of fanfiction around the Harry Potter universe, much is there so people can create and develop their own creativity. Clearly if the intention were to try to cash in on the success of J K Rowling then things would change.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, copyright is about intent. The intent to deliberately cash in on the work of others will most likely end up with a court case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>However, what about AI? Does it make copying too easy and where is the intention? If AI is not trained on copyrighted material, will it ever be useful to everyone? We need to balance the societal benefit with the potential negative impacts, another ethical consideration.<\/p>",

Data sharing agreements, on the other hand, are valuable when collaborating with multiple parties, handling sensitive data, or requiring unique terms.

A data sharing agreement ensures that both parties have a clear understanding of how the shared data will be used, including access rights, data security measures, and limitations on data sharing. This helps establish trust and accountability between the collaborators.</p> <h2>Fraud detection</h2> <p>Financial organisations are required to collaborate in order to maintain a stable market. One aspect of this is sharing data that assists the detection of fraudulent transactions, often using automated models. A data sharing agreement outlines the terms of data contribution, data access, and the responsibilities of each organisation in maintaining data privacy. It also defines the rights to use the resulting model and how any insights or improvements will be shared.</p> <h2>Species protection</h2> <p>AI is increasingly used to help build climate models that help predict the impact on our habitat. One key aspect of this is to model the threat to endangered species, data about which might include information about the location, behaviour, and habitat of these species. Sharing this data without proper controls could lead to poaching, habitat destruction, or disturbance to their ecosystems, endangering their survival further. By applying data sharing agreements in this context, AI can be used effectively to model species movement while respecting the ethical considerations and responsibilities associated with endangered species protection.</p>",

This phase involves identifying and understanding the ethical dilemma at hand. Clarity in defining the situation is crucial for several reasons:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Contextual Understanding</strong>: Clearly defining the situation provides context and background information. It helps stakeholders understand the specific circumstances, parties involved, and the nature of the ethical challenge.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Stakeholder Identification</strong>: By clarifying the situation, you can identify all parties who may be affected by the decision. This includes individuals, groups, organisations, or communities that have a stake in the outcome.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Scope Delimitation</strong>: A well-defined situation helps establish the scope of the ethical evaluation. It outlines the boundaries of the ethical dilemma and prevents ambiguity that can lead to irrelevant considerations.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Issue Recognition</strong>: Clear definition of the situation enables the identification of the core ethical issue. This helps avoid confusion and ensures that the ethical evaluation remains focused on the essential aspects.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Informed Analysis</strong>: An accurately described situation provides the necessary information for ethical analysis. Ethical theories and principles can be applied more effectively when the situation is well-understood.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Ethical Implications</strong>: A precise understanding of the situation allows for a more comprehensive exploration of potential ethical implications. It helps uncover the different angles, consequences, and considerations associated with the dilemma.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Objective Decision-Making</strong>: Clarity in the situation promotes objective decision-making. A well-defined situation reduces the risk of bias or misinterpretation influencing the ethical evaluation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Communication and Transparency</strong>: A clear description of the situation enables effective communication with stakeholders. Transparent communication builds trust and helps stakeholders understand the rationale behind the decisions made.</li>\n</ol><p>In essence, being clear on the situation is akin to laying the groundwork for a solid ethical evaluation. It ensures that all subsequent steps in the ethical decision-making process are rooted in a well-understood context, promoting thorough analysis, informed choices, and ethical integrity.</p>",

Care should be taken to not fall into bad habit that will erode trust including:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> When organisations or individuals withhold information, intentions, or actions, it can lead to suspicions and undermine trust. The absence of clear communication and openness can breed uncertainty among stakeholders. It is not always deliberate, but taking the time early to prioritise transparency will pay back dividends later.</li>\n<li><strong>Blame Culture:</strong> In environments where blame is disproportionately assigned rather than problems being collectively addressed, trust erodes. This culture discourages individuals from taking ownership and fosters a sense of insecurity and ultimately results in a lack of accountability, one of the key guiding principles.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconsistent Messaging:</strong> When messages or actions contradict each other, it can create confusion and scepticism. Inconsistent communication undermines trust in the authenticity of intentions.</li>\n<li><strong>Unaccountable Behaviour:</strong> When individuals or entities avoid taking responsibility for their actions and consequences, it diminishes trust. Unaccountable behaviour erodes confidence in the reliability of promises.</li>\n<li><strong>Hidden Agendas:</strong> Concealed motives or undisclosed interests can lead to suspicions of ulterior motives. When stakeholders perceive hidden agendas, it weakens trust in the integrity of decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Unequal Treatment:</strong> When favouritism or unequal treatment becomes evident, trust in fairness is compromised. This can manifest as preferential treatment based on personal connections rather than merit.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Inclusivity:</strong> Exclusion or lack of involvement of stakeholders in decision-making processes can generate feelings of mistrust. When individuals are excluded, it implies that their perspectives are not valued.</li>\n<li><strong>Inaction on Feedback:</strong> Ignoring or dismissing feedback from stakeholders suggests a disregard for their opinions and needs. This inaction can breed mistrust as stakeholders feel unheard.</li>\n<li><strong>Secrecy Surrounding Decisions:</strong> When decisions are made behind closed doors without transparency or input, it can foster scepticism and mistrust about the motives and rationale behind those decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent Ethical Violations:</strong> Frequent ethical violations or a pattern of unethical behaviour can erode trust over time. Stakeholders may doubt an organisation's commitment to ethical conduct.</li>\n</ol>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Situation</strong></p><p>In the mid 2010s, a team at Amazon had been investigating the use of machine learning and AI to review job applicants’ resumes with the aim of mechanising the search for top talent. This AI-driven endeavour aimed to streamline the screening process and identify the most promising candidates, offering a potential solution to the company's recruitment challenges.</p><p><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p>Amazon's initiative to develop an AI-powered recruitment tool reflects their proactive approach to grappling with the complexities of handling a large number of applications. By utilising AI algorithms to automate preliminary screening, the company intended to optimise the hiring process, improve efficiency, and allocate human resources more effectively. It was noted at this stage that the tool was biased toward men and ultimately this led to the decision following being an easy one to make. However, a notable weakness during the analysis was a failure to recognise legal and ethical challenges relating to the use of personal data in resumes submitted over a 10-year period to train the tool.</p><p><strong>Decision</strong></p><p>Upon critical examination of the AI system's outcomes, Amazon chose not to employ the technology for final hiring decisions due to identified gender bias concerns. However, the company opted to leverage some components of the tool for ancillary functions, revealing their adaptability and commitment to refining their approach based on the ethical implications that emerged during analysis. Even though this is a somewhat positive outcome, Amazon's decision to keep the AI project and the associated data's use confidential to this point was their undoing.</p><p><strong>Action and Monitoring</strong></p><p>Amazon's action to not use the tool does offer some hope of them taking ethical responsibility. Despite choosing not to proceed with the tool for hiring decisions, they found value in repurposing it to filter out duplicates and ensure basic application criteria alignment. However, the secretive nature of the project and the use of personal data without explicit consent eroded trust, casting a shadow over the entire initiative. Although Amazon claimed never to have used the tool, the lack of transparency surrounding both the project and the data used for training fueled scepticism and undermined the company's reputation. This clearly demonstrates that the ethical decision-making process marks the beginning of a journey filled with responsibilities and commitments and should start before any analysis or application.&nbsp;</p><p>In this context, Amazon's venture into AI-driven recruitment highlights the intricate interplay between technology, ethics, and transparency. While the initiative demonstrated Amazon's commitment to ethical decision-making by discontinuing biassed AI usage, the secrecy surrounding the development and data usage led to a loss of trust. This scenario underscores the importance of open communication, transparency, and safeguarding individual data privacy when implementing AI solutions to address complex challenges, even if you don’t end up using them.</p>",
